# odysee-simple-alerts-connector

This nodecg bundle listens for LBC tips from odysee hyperchat's and renders an alert using the simple-alerts bundle.

In future releases, this bundle may make use of other bundles such as:
* donation ticker
* chat overlay
* tip history
* top tipper

In releases, you can find a portable version containing nodecg and simple-alerts for Windows and Linux that is ready to go, just extract it and run it.
